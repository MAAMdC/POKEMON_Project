            <p>Pikachu has gone missing again. What could that yellow rat be up to? We don't have time for this. 
                Eevee's birthday is right around the corner and he's the only one who still hasn't come up with a birthday gift!
                He's so stubborn. Everyone knows this year Eeevee is evolving and we're working hard to make that moment memorable.
                Mhmm... What if... Yes, that's it! You! Would you mind lending us a hand and go search for him? It would be a HUGE help.
                I hope he hasn't got himself in trouble again. And please hurry!</p>

            <p>Pikachu is on the other side of the board. Rush to him as fast as you can so you can take him to Eevee's birthday party.
                The faster you get to him, the more time Pikachu will have to pick a birthday gift to please Eeevee. But beware, there might
                be a few friends in need who'll try and stop you to ask for help with the party preparations. Gotta help them all, I guess?</p>
